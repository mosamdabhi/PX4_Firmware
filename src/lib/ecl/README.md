Very lightweight Estimation & Control Library.

This library solves the estimation & control problems of a number of robots and drones. It accepts GPS, vision and inertial sensor inputs. It is extremely lightweight and efficient and yet has the rugged field-proven performance.

The library is currently BSD licensed, but might move to Apache 2.0.
